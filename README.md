PHP Ergast API
==============

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd/), written with PHP7.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.1
* [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library,
* (optional) PHPUnit to run tests.

## Install

Via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require brieucthomas/ergast-client php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

Why `php-http/guzzle6-adapter`? We are decoupled from any HTTP messaging client with help by [HTTPlug](http://httplug.io/). Read about clients in our [docs](doc/customize.md).

## Basic usage

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Ergast\Client();
$response = $client->sendRequest('/f1/circuits/monza');
```
